# 30 Days Of SQL: Day 28 - Building a Real-World Project

Welcome to **Day 28** of the **30 Days of SQL** challenge! 🎉 Today, we’ll take a hands-on approach by applying everything you’ve learned to build a real-world SQL project. This is your chance to consolidate your knowledge, tackle practical challenges, and gain confidence in solving complex data problems.

## Project Overview

### Project Title: **Sales Analysis for an E-Commerce Platform**

You’ll design and execute SQL queries to analyze sales data for an online e-commerce company. The goal is to generate insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. These insights can help the company improve its decision-making process.

## Dataset Description

We’ll be working with the following tables:

## Project Tasks

### 1. Basic Data Exploration
- View the first few rows of each table to understand the data.
- Check for any missing values or inconsistencies.

### 2. Analyze Customer Behavior
- Find the total number of customers and the number of customers by country.
- Identify the top 5 countries with the highest number of customers.
- Calculate the average number of orders per customer.

### 3. Product Performance Analysis
- List the top 10 best-selling products based on total quantity sold.
- Identify the top 5 product categories by revenue.
- Find products that are underperforming (low sales and high stock).

### 4. Sales Trends Analysis
- Calculate monthly sales revenue for the last year.
- Identify the month with the highest sales.
- Determine the average order value (AOV).

### 5. Advanced Insights
- Analyze repeat customers by identifying customers who placed more than 3 orders.
- Find the product-category combinations that generate the most revenue.
- Calculate the percentage contribution of each product to total revenue.

## SQL Queries

Here are some examples of queries you’ll write for this project:

### 1. View Data from a Table
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Customers
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Total Number of Customers
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_customers
FROM Customers;
```

### 3. Best-Selling Products
```sql
SELECT p.product_name, SUM(od.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM Order_Details od
JOIN Products p ON od.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 4. Monthly Sales Revenue
```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month, SUM(total_amount) AS monthly_revenue
FROM Orders
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

### 5. Repeat Customers
```sql
SELECT c.customer_id, COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
HAVING COUNT(o.order_id) > 3;
```

## Deliverables

1. **SQL Script**: A collection of all queries you write during the project.
2. **Analysis Report**: A short report summarizing your findings.
3. **Visualization** (Optional): Use tools like Tableau or Excel to create visualizations for key metrics.

---

## Hands-On Challenge

- Write SQL queries to answer the questions in the tasks above.
- Document your process and results.
- Share your insights and suggestions for improving the e-commerce platform’s performance.
